# The Anti-Entropic Principle of Morality

## Deriving Ethics from Complexity Minimization in Conscious Networks

This repository contains the complete mathematical framework and experimental protocols for deriving morality from first principles using the Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP).

> **Core Insight**: Moral actions are those that minimize the descriptive complexity of networks of conscious agents.
